# Problem Statement
This project delves into designing a compact, open-source **System on Chip (SoC)** based on **RVMYTH**, a RISC-V-based processor core. The SoC integrates a **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** for precise clock generation and control, alongside a **10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** for interfacing with external analog systems. By converting digital signals into analog, this DAC allows BabySoC to communicate with devices that accept analog inputs, such as televisions and mobile phones, enabling output in the form of audio or video. Ultimately, this Sky130-technology-based SoC aims to provide a highly documented, educational platform for learning and experimentation in digital-analog interfacing.
